  README
================================================================================

This document is being used to keep track of changes to this repo in order to
make it match the OLD 0.2.7 production code that is deployed as of Feb 2014. 
This code was changed ad hoc on the server so I do not currently have a local
version that works like the deployed version, which is ridiculous.  So, making
the changes listed below should remedy that.


Todo
================================================================================

1. Check that deployed functionality is all there in this dev eniro.
   Seems to be good.  ExPex export works, as does display of phonetic
   transcription lines.

2. Create a git repo in this directory.

3. Watch out for hairy dependency issues; i.e., the deployment env might be very
   hacked together compared to the Python 2.5 env on this dev machine (ugh ...)


Issues Observed
================================================================================

1. Export to LaTeX.  xelatex typesetting will not work properly when fontspec
   and its dependencies are loaded AND expex is loaded on a Debian TexLive 2009
   install.  All of the \gla words are "it" !!!!  Anyways, it works when you
   remove \usepackage{fontspec} and it works on more recent TexLive installs.
   This may be something to watch for when I implement automatic .tex2.pdf 
   server-side.


Changes made
================================================================================

1. copied production's controllers/file.py to controllers/PROD_file.py

2. copied production's controllers/settings.py to controllers/PROD_settings.py

3. copied production's lib/orthography.py to lib/PROD_orthography.py

4. copied production's lib/test_functions.py

5. copied production's public/index-ria.html; I then deleted the
   public/index.html file since these are the same files. THESE ARE THE SPA
   JQUERY LANDING PAGES.

6. copied production's templates/base/formViews.html to
   templates/base/PROD_formViews.html

7. copied production's templates/derived/collection/addUpdateFields.html to
   templates/derived/collection/PROD_addUpdateFields.html

8. copied production's templates/derived/file/addUpdateFields.html to
   templates/derived/file/PROD_addUpdateFields.html

9. reconcile the diffs between the PROD_-prefixed files and their counterparts.

    1. took PROD_file.py and deleted file.py --- cosmetic changes only.

    2. took PROD_settings.py and copied settings.py to settings.py_bk --- changes
       to a try/except block and the PROD version used a custom error (whose name
       was changed from the incorrect OrthographyIncompatibilityError to the 
       correct OrthographyCompatibilityError).

    3. took PROD_orthography.py and deleted orthography.py --- cosmetic changes
       only.

    4. Changed validDelimiters to morphDelimiters in formViews.html as per
       PROD_formViews.html.  Note that both the production egg and this version
       both have a validDelimiters property defined in lib/oldCoreObjects.py.

    5. took /collection/PROD_addUpdateFields.html: some improved select options
       for app_globals.

    6. took /file/PROD_addUpdateFields.html: some improved select options for
       app_globals.
